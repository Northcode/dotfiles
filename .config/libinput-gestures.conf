# Configuration file for libinput-gestures.
#
# The default configuration file exists at /etc/libinput-gestures.conf
# but a user can create a personal custom configuration file at
# ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored. Currently
# "gesture" and "device" configuration keywords are supported as
# described below. The keyword can optionally be appended with a ":" (to
# maintain compatibility with original format configuration files).
#
# Each gesture line has 3 [or 4] arguments:
#
# action motion [finger_count] command
#
# where action and motion is either:
#     swipe up
#     swipe down
#     swipe left
#     swipe right
#     pinch in
#     pinch out
#
# command is the remainder of the line and is any valid shell command +
# arguments.
#
# finger_count is a single numeric digit and is optional (and is
# typically 3 or 4). If specified then the command is executed when
# exactly that number of fingers is used in the gesture. If not
# specified then the command is executed when that gesture is executed
# with any number of fingers. Gesture lines specified with finger_count
# have priority over the same gesture specified without any
# finger_count.
#
# Typically command will be xdotool, or wmctrl. See "man xdotool" for
# the many things you can action with that tool. Note that unfortunately
# xdotool does not work with native Wayland clients.
#
# Note the default is an "internal" command that uses wmctrl to switch
# workspaces and, unlike xdotool, works on both Xorg and Wayland (via
# XWayland). It also can be configured for vertical and horizontal
# switching over tabular workspaces, as per the example below. You can
# also add "-w" to the internal command to allow wrapping workspaces.

# gesture tap 	       	4 rofi -show run

# Move to next workspace (works for GNOME/KDE/etc on Wayland and Xorg)

# Previous and next in firefox
gesture swipe down	3  bash -c "[[ $(bspc query -N -n focused | xargs bspc query -T -n | jq .client.className | tr -d '\"') == \"Firefox\" ]] && xdotool key alt+Left || true"
gesture swipe up	3  bash -c "[[ $(bspc query -N -n focused | xargs bspc query -T -n | jq .client.className | tr -d '\"') == \"Firefox\" ]] && xdotool key alt+Right || true"
gesture swipe right	3  bash -c "[[ $(bspc query -N -n focused | xargs bspc query -T -n | jq .client.className | tr -d '\"') == \"Firefox\" ]] && xdotool key ctrl+shift+Tab || true"
gesture swipe left	3  bash -c "[[ $(bspc query -N -n focused | xargs bspc query -T -n | jq .client.className | tr -d '\"') == \"Firefox\" ]] && xdotool key ctrl+Tab || true"
# gesture swipe down	xdotool key super+Page_Up

# Browser go forward (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture swipe left	4 bspc desktop -f next

# Browser go back (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture swipe right	4 bspc desktop -f prev

# NOTE: If you don't use "natural" scrolling direction for your touchpad
# then you may want to swap the above default left/right and up/down
# configurations.

# Optional extended swipe gestures, e.g. for browser tab navigation:
#
# Jump to next open browser tab
# gesture swipe right_up xdotool key control+Tab
#
# Jump to previous open browser tab
# gesture swipe left_up xdotool key control+shift+Tab
#
# Close current browser tab
# gesture swipe left_down xdotool key control+w
#
# Reopen and jump to last closed browser tab
# gesture swipe right_down xdotool key control+shift+t

# Example of 8 static workspaces, e.g. using KDE virtual-desktops,
# arranged in 2 rows of 4 across using swipe up/down/left/right to
# navigate in fixed planes. Must match how you have configured your
# virtual desktops.
# gesture swipe up	_internal --col=2 ws_up
# gesture swipe down	_internal --col=2 ws_down
# gesture swipe left	_internal --row=4 ws_up
# gesture swipe right	_internal --row=4 ws_down

# Example virtual desktop switching for Ubuntu Unity/Compiz. The
# _internal command does not work for Compiz but you can explicitly
# configure the swipe commands to work for a Compiz virtual 2
# dimensional desktop as follows:
# gesture swipe up	xdotool key ctrl+alt+Up
# gesture swipe down	xdotool key ctrl+alt+Down
# gesture swipe left	xdotool key ctrl+alt+Left
# gesture swipe right	xdotool key ctrl+alt+Right

# GNOME SHELL open/close overview (works for GNOME on Wayland and Xorg)
#gesture pinch in 

gesture pinch out dbus-send --session --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell.Eval string:'Main.overview.toggle();'

# Optional extended pinch gestures:
# gesture pinch clockwise <whatever command>
# gesture pinch anticlockwise <whatever command>

# This application normally determines your touchpad device
# automatically. Some users may have multiple touchpads but by default
# we use only the first one found. However, you can choose to specify
# the explicit device name to use. Run libinput-list-devices to work out
# the name of your device (from the "Device:" field). Then add a device
# line specifying that name, e.g:
#
# device DLL0665:01 06CB:76AD Touchpad
#
# Or you can choose to use ALL touchpad devices by setting the device
# name to "all". This reduces performance slightly so only set this if
# you need to.
